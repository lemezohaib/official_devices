# Keep in mind...
- DO NOT USE any other recovery than TWRP recovery which is linked in the XDA thread.
- YOU MUST CLEAN FLASH IF:
    - You are coming from any other ROM or MIUI
    - You are coming from previous Android Version
- Magisk should only be flashed after booting once into the ROM. Do not flash Magisk along with the ROM package
- Use the latest hyperos firmware for your region
- Use recommended recoveries i-e TWRP 3.8 or awakenOS recovery
- If you face issues like poor RAM management or storage issues, you have not followed the instructions and/or have changed kernel/recovery. STRICTLY follow the instructions provided again before reporting any issues.
